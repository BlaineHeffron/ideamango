Repository for IdeaMango (or whatever we end up calling it)

ABOUT THE WEBSITE (short - scroll down for long description):
#############################################################################
The website will be broken up into two main categories - ideas, and projects
Users can create an idea page, where they talk about their idea and why they think its good and why they want it to happen.
Users can create a project page - this is used to describe the project you are working on, whether it spawned from an idea on the website or not. On an idea page there will be a "turn it into a project" button which will notify all of the people associated with the idea that someone has begun working on turning the idea into reality.

Users can vote up ideas and projects if they like them. (I may only allow this feature for ideas) The purpose of this is to sort ideas and projects by what is most liked by the community. This will encourage the best ideas (the ones that alot of people think would be useful) to get done by bringing the most attention to them.

Users can post jobs or tasks associated with their project that they need help with. This will be a description ofo what you ened done, they type of skills needed to get it done, and tags to describe the job / skills.

Users can find ideas / projects/ jobs by going to their respective pages and looking at the idea / project / job feed. Users can sort these feeds by "Most liked", "most popular" (most viewed) and "most recent".
Users can also use search terms to filter by tags, search in title / descriptions / author, etc.

I want this to be a site that emphasizes the possibility of getting stuff done WITHOUT MONEY. We see this all over the internet with open source projects, why not make this sort of thing more prevalent in our everyday lives?

ABOUT THE WEBSITE (long):
##########################################################################################################################
  I envision the website being a place where people can share their ideas about anything, whether it is a big idea such as the reorganizing of the US economic system or a small idea like an iphone application. If you have a cool idea, and you want to share it to the community just post it on the site - whether its to discuss the idea and refine it, to make it reality, or to just share the idea for the heck of it.

  To share an idea, one creates an idea page. This will be similar to a kickstarter project - it will have a short description of your idea to be displayed when searching for ideas, and it will have the detailed description with pictures and videos and whatever you would like to use to describe your idea. Users can "subscribe" to an idea if they like it - this will allow you to get email updates from it whenever the idea creator changes the idea (or just wants to send updates to the subscribers). You can also "like" an idea - similar to voting up on reddit. This, like reddit, serves as a way of displaying the ideas that are the most popular among users.

  Ideas will show up on the main ideas page - (ideas.php) this will serve as a hub for finding ideas that you are interested in. The top of the "idea display box" will have a search bar where you can search for tags that were previously selected by the creator of the idea to find things you are interested in. I also think I will allow users to control where the search terms are searched in (i.e. tags, title, description, author name, author username, location etc) You can also filter what is displayed by "most popular" (ideas that have the most page views), "most liked" (ideas with the most "likes"), and "most recent". Finally, like on kickstarter, you can choose to look at ideas within a certain location. Right now I have the location structure as a hierarchical model starting with city at the bottom, then region (or state/ province), and country at the top. This model will be more important for the "projects" section

I want this page to be as versatile, but also as easy to use as possible so as best


The basic structure of the website is as fo

Perhaps I should call the website "do stuff together" because I want the website to not only be a place where you share your idea, but you get like minded individuals to discuss and refine the diea, then you turn it into reality with those people. So its really more about getting together and doing stuff you want to do. It can be anything, art, programming, music, screenwriting, engineering, science, politics, community betterment projects, etc etc. You can look at the ideas/ projects in your area by sorting by location. (ideas and projects will have an associated location). Each project/idea will also have tags as another method of search.
